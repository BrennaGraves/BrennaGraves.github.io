            Social implications as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic have shown to have major effects on social our interactions, mental and phsycial health. As a result, there have been disruptions to our "normal" everyday life. It's believed to have affected almost everyone across the globe. In America, the social implications are found in areas of work, school, religion, personal/family relationships, and activities of errands, traveling, shopping, and eating. Many of this is caused by the transition to online work/school, isolation/quarantining, social distancing/mask-wearing, and travel/health/occupancy restrictions. Our social interactions have changed because of fear around the virus. Many are scared to be arround people because health experts have deemed it to be dangerous. In an effort to protect yourself and others, the CDC, WHO, and health officials have advocated for mask-wearing, social distancing, and vaccine injections. This has caused legislators and businesses to restrict the number of occupants/visitors in buildings, change uniform/attire guidelines for staff and customers, and change operation means. Because our interactions have become distant and stigmatized, people's outlooks, opinions, and emotions have been affected. Because people are, and or are believed to be getting sick, our physical interactions have become distant and thought to be dangerous. This makes people isolate themselves, it can make them aggitated, and stressed. We know this can also make them physically and mental make them ill. We've seen a great rise in mental illness, which is to be expected when there's very emotionally-driven media outpourings/they are influenced to be fearful and angry, their routine's are changed, and their social interactions decrease. People can become very unhappy, paranoid, and anxious.

          Because of the disruption to the workforce, Congress decided to send out checks to families affected by the implications of the pandemic, for them to spend and "stimulate" the economy. The money hardly helped those affected and didn't last long since the pandemic has continued. While this was supposed to help in the mean time, it won't in the long-run since this will add to our national debt and tax payers will be paying back this loan for years to come.  were to get the Corona Virus.
