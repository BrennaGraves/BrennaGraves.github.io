        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
            Social implications as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic have shown to have major effects on social our interactions, mental and phsycial health. As a result, there have been disruptions to our "normal" everyday life. It's believed to have affected almost everyone across the globe. In America, the social implications are found in areas of work, school, religion, personal/family relationships, and activities of errands, traveling, shopping, and eating. Many of this is caused by the transition to online work/school, isolation/quarantining, social distancing/mask-wearing, and travel/health/occupancy restrictions. Our social interactions have changed because of fear around the virus. Many are scared to be arround people because health experts have deemed it to be dangerous. In an effort to protect yourself and others, the CDC, WHO, and health officials have advocated for mask-wearing, social distancing, and vaccine injections. This has caused legislators and businesses to restrict the number of occupants/visitors in buildings, change uniform/attire guidelines for staff and customers, and change operation means. Because our interactions have become distant and stigmatized, people's outlooks, opinions, and emotions have been affected. Because people are, and or are believed to be getting sick, our physical interactions have become distant and thought to be dangerous. This makes people isolate themselves, it can make them aggitated, and stressed. We know this can also make them physically and mental make them ill. We've seen a great rise in mental illness, which is to be expected when there's very emotionally-driven media outpourings/they are influenced to be fearful and angry, their routine's are changed, and their social interactions decrease. People can become very unhappy, paranoid, and anxious.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pt-2 rounded-top mb-0">
            Economic implications, as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, have shown to have dramatic effects on the workforce through increased unemployment, disruptions in the supply chains, the monoplolization of big corporations and the loss of local/small businesses. Many businesses shut down due to legislational guidance/restrictions, social advocacy, decreasing in size, or shifting to virtual work, which caused the unemployment rate to increase. With many people out of work, consumer spending dropped along with inventory and productions, and supply chains got disrupted. Many businesses tried to accomidate to the restrictions and influences by having employees work remotely. Businesses and employees were labled as essential or non-essential, which allowed for big organizations and companies to almost monopolize the market and kill local and small businesses.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pb-2 pt-3 rounded-bottom">
          Because of the disruption to the workforce, Congress decided to send out checks to families affected by the implications of the pandemic, for them to spend and "stimulate" the economy. The money hardly helped those affected and didn't last long since the pandemic has continued. While this was supposed to help in the mean time, it won't in the long-run since the pandemic and its effects have continued and because this will add to our national debt having tax payers paying back this "loan" for years to come.

        <h4 class="text-light bg-danger p-2 mt-4 mb-0 rounded"> <strong> Political Implications </strong> </h4>
        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
             The political implications of Covid have increased the political divide in American. Since two administrations have been involved in the pandemic, there's been many arguments about its handling between the parties. The response has brought wide-spread awareness to the medical industry, the state, local, and federal powers/roles, and global organizations/governance. Many have called into question the intentions behind those influencing and implementing the rules/guidelines. The pandemic has increased people's awareness of the influence big organizations and governements have on the national and global economy. Many argue over the health experts' honesty, intelligence, influence, and intions. Many claim the pandemic is politically motivated for it being around the time of the election, the intense imposing political influence, and the support and attraction of high-profiled businesses, celebrities, media networks, and world leaders. There is now a huge debate between what guidances and restrictions are ethical and effective. Mask mandates have people arguing over how effective they are at preventing the spread of covid and if mask-wearing is an argument over bodily autonomy, or an ethical/social responsibility. Many question the honesty and legitimacy behind health experts' and world leaders' data, financial ties, and influences. Because there is a lot of doubt and distrust among citizens, many smear campains, emotionally triggering advertising, and repetitive/inconsistent information is being used to divide people. The need for power is at an all-time high between political parties and organizations. This has made for legislation appeals and changes that have people questioning the ethics behind freedom and social responsibility.

                In conclusion, we have seen that the Covid-19 Pandemic has had tremendous effects on not only our nation, but the entire globe. The social, economic, and political affects have altered life as we know it. Decisions are being made to influence towards a "back to normal" life, or to a "new normal" life. What's happening right now will be talked about in textbooks and history lessons. We are at a historical time and it's important for people to stay informed, involved, and active in gearing our course of history in the right direction. Conversations are so important for coming to an effective and efficient solution. It's hard to process all the changes and the severity of the pandemic's influence. But, we must have honest and hard conversations. We must allow ourselves to be humbled by others and be hungry for unity. By standing together with one another and working toward a common goal, we can better our country and the world. I truely believe there is a spiritual warfare happening and we must unite against evil influences towards a more ethical and moral world.
