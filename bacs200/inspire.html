        Candace Owens is someone I look up to because she models confidence, intelligence, and courage. She strives to enhance our awareness of the reality and intentions behind political agendas happening today.

        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kind - they act with good intent and have upstanding morals and ethics</li>
        <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
        <li>Intelligent - they are knowledgeable about their cause and are constantly trying to learn more</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Currently, Candance embodies these traits to me and I look up to her for guidance during these times.
